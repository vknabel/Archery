# üèπ Archery

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/vknabel-Archery/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/vknabel-Archery/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/vknabel-Archery/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

*Archery* allows you to declare all your project's metadata and what you can do with it in one single place.

Within Archery all your data is centralized as YAML in one file called `Archerfile`, which will be passed to arrows as JSON. The whole content of that file is treated as metadata. Within `scripts` you declare whatever you want to run.

The following code shows how an Archerfile may look like. Besides the name and version of the project, it declares two scripts:
```yaml
name: YourProject
help: Thanks for downloading this project and trying it out.
version: 1.0.0
scripts:
  xcproj:
    arrow: vknabel/BashArrow
    help: Generate the Xcode Project for the current SPM project
    command: swift package generate-xcodeproj
  generate-version:
    arrow: vknabel/StencilArrow
    help: Injects the current version into the SPM project
    template: Version.swift.stencil
    destination: Sources/ArcheryKit/Version.generated.swift
    searchPaths: [Scripts]

```
* `$ archery xcproj` will use [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) to load [vknabel/BashArrow](https://github.com/vknabel/BashArrow), which executes a given command. Whenever you want to run simple scripts on the command line which do not require global installs, this is an universal way to go.
* `$ archery generate-version` is based on [vknabel/StencilArrow](https://github.com/vknabel/StencilArrow). It will pass all contents of the Archerfile to render the contents of `Version.swift.stencil` using the [Stencil](https://github.com/kylef/Stencil) language. Whenever you need information of your Archerfile inside other files, this way should be the most convenient.

If you are new to a project, Archery will help you to get started as it acts as a project internal CLI. The generated help for the Archerfile can be accessed as below.

```bash
$ archery
Thanks for downloading this project and trying it out.

Available Commands:

    generate-version  Injects the current version into the SPM project
    xcproj            Generate the Xcode Project for the current SwiftPM project
```

No matter which arrow you will choose for your scripts: it comes with all dependencies it needs. No need for any additional commands.

## Scripts
The script tag at root level drives the available subcommands and is interpreted as Array of scripts.

| Option        | Default   | Description               |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| `arrow`       | Required  | Github repository for a Swift CLI. See [vknabel/ArrowKit](https://github.com/vknabel/ArrowKit/blob/master/README.md). |
| `version`     | `master`  | The version that shall be used. Will be cached within `.archery/mint` |
| `help`        | None      | The description of the script. |
| `nestedArrow` | `false`   | Treat subcommands as arrow. Allows to write arrows in different languages. See [vknabel/ArrowKit](https://github.com/vknabel/ArrowKit/blob/master/README.md). |

## Getting Started

In order to use Archery within your own project, either create your Archerfile by hand or let Archery create one for you.

```bash
$ archery init
üèπ  Created at Archerfile
```

Now you can add all your metadata and scripts. Don't know where to start? Here are some examples for you:

* If you develop a library you could generate your `.podspec`, `Package.swift` and `Cartfile`. All your dependencies would be declared within your Archerfile, the manifests would be generated using [vknabel/StencilArrow](https://github.com/vknabel/StencilArrow).
* What is your release process? Why not start it using `$ archery release`? As this script will be more complex, the best would be to use [vknabel/ArcheryArrow](https://github.com/vknabel/ArcheryArrow). You can find a more complete list at the [Available Arrows](#available-arrows).
* What do you need to install or configure in order to get started with your project? You could move some dependencies into arrows or guide the new users through a tutorial. You can find a more complete list at the [Available Arrows](#available-arrows).

## Installation


### Using Mint
```bash
$ mint run vknabel/Archery
```

### Using Marathon
```bash
$ marathon run vknabel/archery
```

### Swift Package Manager
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vknabel/Archery.git
$ cd Archery
$ swift build -c release
$ cp -f .build/release/archery /usr/local/bin/archery
```

Archery can also be embedded within your own CLI using SwiftPM.

## Available Arrows
Currently the following arrows are known. Feel free to add your own arrows. If you want to write your own arrow head over to [vknabel/ArrowKit](https://github.com/vknabel/ArrowKit/blob/master/README.md) and feel free to add to add your own arrow here.

[vknabel/BeakArrow](https://github.com/vknabel/BeakArrow) Run functions inside Swift files.
*Based on [yonaskolb/Beak](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Beak).*

* Great to keep related programs together
* Automate your project
* Write custom arrows in Swift using `"nestedArrow": true`

### Stencil

* Create new models or classes

### Marathon
[vknabel/MarathonArrow](https://github.com/vknabel/MarathonArrow) Run Swift scripts.
*Based on [JohnSundell/Marathon](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Marathon).*

* Write arrows that are specific to your project with `"nestedArrow": true`
* Automate your project

### Mint
[vknabel/MintArrow](https://github.com/vknabel/MintArrow) Run CLIs written in Swift. Internally used for all arrows.
*Based on [yonaskolb/Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint).*

* Run Swiftlint, SwiftFormat and other scripts
* Install local dependencies when needed



## Development Status
As Archery is still in early development I want every user to know as early as possible what may actually change or break in future. This project uses semantic versioning. Version 1.0.0 will be released when known bugs are fixed, all major features have been implemented and upcoming one can be implemented without breaking changes. Additional requirements are a good documentation and good error messages. Until 1.0 has been reached minor updates may break, but patches will stay patches and hence safe for updates.

### Archerfile Loaders
In bigger projects the `Archerfile` may get huge when used regularly. Later it shall be possible to extract some JSON values into external files and even other scripts. As the `Archerfile` should not be read directly, this update won‚Äôt break arrows.
